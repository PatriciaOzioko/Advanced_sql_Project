--Project Title: Exploring the Heart of Airbnb: A Data Journey Through Listings, Hosts, and Neighborhoods in Athens.
--Project Title Explaination- This is a SQL project is based on the Airbnb_athens dataset. Ii is focused on the exploration
--and a deep dive into the data that powers the platform. I split the dataset in two, one is called AirBnB-listings_Athens and the other is called Apartment

--(A)  Retriveing the names and prices of all listings
--This will help lay the foundation for understanding the dataset and the information available for each listing.
SELECT Ai.price, Ap.name
FROM dbo.AirBnB_listings_Athens$ AS Ai
JOIN dbo.Apartment$ AS Ap 
ON Ai.host_id = Ap.host_id


--(B) Filtering and Sorting names and prices of listing in the Goudi area.
-- I narrowed down my focus to a specific neighborhood (Goudi), to extract valuable insights through data manipulation.
SELECT Ai.price, Ap.name
FROM dbo.AirBnB_listings_Athens$ AS Ai
JOIN dbo.Apartment$ AS Ap 
ON Ai.host_id = Ap.host_id
WHERE neighbourhood = 'Goudi'
ORDER BY price desc

--(C) Finding the Average price of all listings
-- This helped me understand the overall pricing trend in the dataset.
SELECT AVG(price) AS AveragePrice
FROM dbo.AirBnB_listings_Athens$

--(D) Finding the Hosts and the number of reviews they have got
-- Connecting hosts with their total number of reviews sheds light on host performance, including those who haven't received reviews—this is a valuable metric for both hosts and potential guests.
SELECT host_id, host_name, COALESCE(COUNT(number_of_reviews), 0) AS TotalReviews
FROM dbo.AirBnB_listings_Athens$
GROUP BY host_id, host_name;

-- It appears that some hosts have multiple Host_id. This may be because they have multiple listings and each listing has its own review
-- To check the total Reviews per host
SELECT host_name, COALESCE(COUNT(number_of_reviews), 0) AS TotalHostReviews
FROM dbo.AirBnB_listings_Athens$
GROUP BY host_name;

--(E) Finding the Host with the highest Average Price for their listings
-- I used CTE to find the highest Average Price
WITH HostAvgPriceCTE AS (

--(F) Find the listings with prices higher than the average price of all listings between 2013 to 2022
--Comparing listing prices to the average price gives insight into individual listing competitiveness and positioning.

        FROM dbo.AirBnB_listings_Athens$
        WHERE last_review BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
    );


--(G) Rank the hosts based on the number of listings they have in each neighborhood
--Ranking hosts based on the number of listings in each neighborhood provided a deeper understanding of host distribution and popularity in different areas.

--(I) Creating a view that combines information about the listing and the host. 
--Constructing a view combining listing and host information helped simplify complex queries and facilitate easier analysis.

FROM
   dbo.AirBnB_listings_Athens$

ORDER BY

--Further checks show that the last review was done 19 months ago. A prospective Customer will find this information valuable.


--(L) Finding the listings with missing values in the "license" column and provide a count.
-- This can prompt further investigation into data quality and completeness
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS MissingLicenseCount

--Recommendations
-- (1) Host Insights: Î‘Î»ÎµÎ¾Î¹Î¿Ï‚ and Markos highest average prices. Other Hosts can learn from thse 2 to help them optimize their pricing strategy.
--(2) Neighborhood Trends: Commercial Triangle-Plaka, Neos Kosmos and Koukaki-Makrygianni neigbourhood has the highest number of listings. This can help guide potential guests in their search.

--(3) Temporal Analysis: It is strange that the last review on any listing in Athens was made 19 months ago. It will be wrong to assume that no activity happened in this period. Temporal patterns and seasonality may be a factor but i believe inadequate data is to blame
--(4) Data Quality: Investigating listings with missing values in the "license" column shows that 3702 listings had no recorded licence. This shows that the is incomplete and data quality improvements are necessary.
